    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> This is to be the webpage of Team Eir. A page requested by an artistic and entuseastic lesbian couple.
        They are purple people and love color. I wanted that to be incorporated without becoming garish.
        I took a light purple and a ligth blue and added a complete contrasing yellow(To really pop).

        <br><br>
        Their page has several functions. They wanted a page that can be a place to show up their art.
        A page that could be home for an ispiration blog.
        Maybe some way of making some money for the website.
        To tell about what they want the page for: 
        To share the message of creativity and creativity through cooperation.

        <h2>State 3 things that have inspired me</h2>
        <p> The main thing thing that inspired me was the girls and the images I was sent. 

            My second influence is my own patronage of websites in genereal and when I compare my
        product to that I cannot say I feel to well! Still the project is still unfinished.
        And, the actual website that will go online will be a lot smoother than this. 
    
        My third inspiration was the work in the cooperative midterms. That was my first ever website. 
        With this my second. So it was very influential. I wish I would have carried more of the 
        elements from that website over to this site, but time contrains have been hard. 
        I had a pure CSS slideshow, i had extensive and careful mediaQueries for screen width.

    <h2>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h2>
    <p>
        I have a languege button for changing language Norwegian - English 
       The setting you choose for language is also saved to localstorage so that makes it easier.

        The website is relativly useable for people with sight impairment. 
        I have alts for pictures, also for the pictures that are preceduraly generated with handlebars!
        I have a high contrast format where the colors of the page are relativly weak and I use maximum
        black for text. The p5 elements are not tabable and are indeed not viewable for sight imparied 
        users, so I do regret making the tabs with p5. 

        I tried my best to keep the website compatible with as many users as possible.
        I was on my way to making the site work without javascript. All menu changes, like language shift.
        changing . Now in this case I have a lot of frontend javascript that would not be natural to
        actually be used on the frontend. Like the loading of the collections and blogs.
        That templating would be done on the backend on an actual website, I assume.
        If any I know I will have issues with older internet explorers, because of things Like
        float and flex, but if any method or syntax had any warnings on them I would not use them.

    </p>


   <h2>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h2>
   <p>
       I tried to make the site intuitive. That cursors change appropriately. I had to fight
       my friends a little. They wanted tabs that changed the html. So you would be playing
       around with the tabs and suddenly load a new html. I put my fot down on this as that would
       have made the page a lot less intuitive and placed links on the top. (I could also have pleased them but then the
       main page would have to have ALL the content, not a good choice when you have alot of images
       to display.) 

       Sorting of elements into groups. For the samling I created groups you can change with
       the tab. This makes getting an overviwe of the content a lot easier. The actual content

       Made the display of the blog a template. This means that if someone wants to make another
       post they do not have to know any web development, but simply fill in a template. 
       I would have Made a place to fill in form to make new posts, 
       but that is just one of many ideas that I did not have time to implement.

    <h2>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site</h2>
    <p>
        State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe
        how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any
        changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site). 
        
        I was a very eager googler during this task. I googled HTML, CSS and javaScript solutions.
        I googled handlebars and 

        I especially got to understand the CSS selectors during making this website.

        I learned that googeling, learning and implementing is a slow(but rewarding) process!

        <h2>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h2>
        <p>
             I was happy with the templating with handlebars. I understand that this
             works much better in the backend. But for this basicly design work, not having 
             to rewrite a bunch of elements when you made achange one part of element was golden.
             Being able to just add to the database to make new elements was also really nice.

             Language switcher. The girls wanted a Norwegian page, and I did not 
             have any idea how to make a multilingual page when I started. I ended up with
             double html for every part that needed to be translated. The only way I saw to get away
             the multiple element language solution I think would be templating. That would 
             mean that most of the page (every element that needed a language change) would
             be a template. As hard as it was working with the template. Harder to write, harder
             to test and much harder to read(Visual studie cannot read it so it is just brown)
             I am happy with my solution. It would be hell just for one more language, but for 
             the two I was happy to be able to implement it.

        <h2>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently
            another time?</h2>
        <p>
             
             I wanted to make so much more! More of everything. A replacement of the p5 tabs
            so that seeing impaired could tab to an element corresponding to the choices.
            Templated modal opening of all the elments in pictures, with extended text in mobile and 
            with a comment field to leave feedback on the images. Similar modal content for blogs.
            Media queries to properly take care of mobile.  
            Image carusels for every element that had several images attached.
            A nice illustration in the p5 field.

            I just ran out of time. I think, less ambition and more time for the features 
            I want . I will also never again take on 
            two projects over summer holiday!
